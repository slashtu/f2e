## Javascript
- Dynamic import - React.lazy

- Tree shaking
  - use `import` 
  - `@babel/preset-env` `modules: false`

- Html `preload`

- Ployfills
  - `@babel/preset-env` `useBuiltIns` `targets`
  
- code splitting

- webpack bundle analyser
- monent.js -> date-fns which support tree shaking and smaller
- 3rd lib, dynamic loading
- performance budget

## Webpack
#### Long term caching with content hash
- the best option is to use contenthash, which will generate a hash based on its content.

#### Common Bundle
- NPM packages change less often than our app code, so we donâ€™t need to force users to download all your NPM packages if nothing has changed. This is usually called the vendor bundle.

- What about your own code that also change less often? Maybe you have a few basic components like Button, Grid, Toggle, etc. that have been created some time ago and haven't changed in a while. This is a good candidate for a common bundle
